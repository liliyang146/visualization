(2) Problem list file names. They should coincide with the HTML names

(3) Videos should play on mobile devices. The whole site should be Mobile Web friendly.  

(4) Math formulae are very difficult and error-prone to enter. Should consider some markup that allows to edit the problems via Web site.  

(5) Math formulae have white background color, which is not nice.
